# BlindToilets
**Plan**
- Make a VR game which incorporates the player doing a simple task, and then having to do the same task, while visually impaired.
- The idea of the app is to give awareness of different types of visual impairments and to show how difficult simple tasks can be for different people.

**Imparity Ideas**
- Colour blind simulator
  - Convert the task into one of the three main colour blindness types (Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia).
- Blind simulator
  - Convert user vision into increasingly more impaired vision. Have different levels of blindness.
  
**Other**
- Drunk
  - We could expand this app to include ideas such as drunk vision. 


**Game Ideas**
- Roll a ball
  - A simple game where the user needs to roll a ball to complete an objective. The environment will be vibrant with colour which will 
    prove much tougher once impairments are implemented.
- Everyday room simulation
  - Have a simulation of everyday tasks, such as making a drink or picking something up and putting it somewhere else.
- Driving
  - Could implement a first person perspective of a driving car and have the user try to point to different hazards.
- Optional VR / mobile
  - Give the user the option of using just their phone or a full VR headset. This should be a key feature as not everyone will have a
    VR headset, or even a phone powerful enough to use a VR headset.
